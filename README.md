The goal of [the initial hack](https://github.com/katbow/annafreud-hackathon)
for this project was to provide a way for clinician to keep track of letters
which needed to be sent on behalf of clients. The clients would receive
notifications as progress on letters was made.

In this prototype, in addition to the above, the client will also be able to
view progress on a client dashboard. As letters are completed, the clinician
can upload the letters so they can be seen by the client. The client can then
provide feedback as necessary.
